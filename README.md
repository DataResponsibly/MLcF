# MLcF

Machine Learning Lifecycle Framework (MLcF) is an experimental toolbox implemented in Python that provides instruments to create a controlled environment to play around with various data errors and stages in the ML lifecycle, and measure their impact on model fairness and stability. The framework's design was guided by three foundational decisions: 1) easy extensibility and modularity that aligns with our ML lifecycle view and empirical approach; 2) flexible functionality that creates a playground with controlled error injection; 3) convenience for conducting multiple experiments with various classification datasets.
